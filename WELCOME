NaRIBaS is a unix-based preparation and analysis toolbox for Nanomaterials and Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in Bulk and Slab'' using bash, Gromacs tools and Matlab. 

The toolbox is to be understood as a scripting framework rather than a black-box software. The scripts provide functions that work as reusable building blocks. Both, task specific input and preparation or analysis functions, are aimed to be easy extendable to meet the scientific characteristic of constant changing properties. User input and task lists are considered as independent blocks hold together by a linking function.

See the Manual for further information.
